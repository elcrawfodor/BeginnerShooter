# Story
The year is 9601.  The Gaussian Fleet has been all but decimated in a last stand to defend Earth from the invading Chronians.  Unable to bear the loss of his home planet, one remaining Gaussian pilot vows to fight off the Chronians for as long as he can before the inevitable demise of his planet.

Unfortunately, time is not on his side.  The Chronians have perfected a technology that leaves them capable of instanteously jumping to any position they were at in another point in time.  Powered by their perpetually rotating ships, the Chronians can evade anything the pilot throws at them by simply time hopping at the last second.

At the very least, the Chronians never made contact with Earth, so they can't warp directly onto the planet.  It's up to you to fend them off for as long as possible while the Earth prepares their defense.

Be careful!  The ship overheats when firing laser beams, so if there's three beams on the screen, you'll need to wait to be able to fire again...
